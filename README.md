# Tiny GS Ground Station Interface using LORA-32 Board
This repository is for code that interfaces with Brown Space Engineering's future ground station using a LORA-32 board and the Tiny-GS network.

# Requirements
* Arduino IDE
* LORA-32 board
* Tiny GS ground station
* Appropriate cables for connecting the LORA-32 board to the ground station

# Usage
* Connect the LORA-32 board to the Tiny GS ground station using the appropriate cables.
* Power on both the LORA-32 board and the ground station.
* Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE.
* Select the appropriate baud rate from the serial monitor settings.
* Use the serial monitor to send and receive data between the LORA-32 board and the ground station.
